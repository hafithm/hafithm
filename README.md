### Hi there, I am Hafith ðŸ‘‹

I am a data scientist with a strong foundation in economics and data analytics, now specializing in applying machine learning to financial markets. Iâ€™m passionate about leveraging advanced data techniques to unlock actionable insights in finance, business intelligence, and sports analytics. With hands-on experience in machine learning, statistical modeling, and automation, I've worked on projects that range from predicting stock market trends to analyzing consumer behavior.

I focus on building predictive models, feature engineering, and creating data visualizations to inform strategic decision-making. My primary interest lies in financial data science, where I use machine learning to optimize investment strategies and analyze financial systems. On GitHub, I document my learning journey and share contributions to open-source projects, explore financial APIs, and tackle complex challenges at the intersection of data science and finance.

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a data analyst with a fervor for sports and a knack for uncovering insights within diverse datasets. With a solid foundation in economics from UBC and specialized training from Light House Labs, I adeptly tackle analytical challenges, often through the lens of my passion for sports analytics. My GitHub repositories reflect a commitment to excellence, showcasing projects that analyze everything from game statistics to economic indicators. As a former student athlete, I understand the power of data in driving performance and strategy, both on and off the field. On this platform, I'm excited to share my journey as I explore the fascinating intersection of data analysis and sports, contribute to open-source projects, and collaborate with fellow data enthusiasts. Whether it's developing models to predict outcomes or creating visualizations that tell the story behind the numbers, my goal is to deliver insights that spark conversation and innovation. Join me here on GitHub as we push the boundaries of data together
